### Junior task

This is my testing task as a junior for parsing given url and retrieving information about elements on the page.

In this task i`m using CURB for opening the page, NOKOGIRI - to parse this page and CSV module for writing results into a file. For retrieving information about DOM elements i use Xpath(regexp could be used for this, nontheless this is a future task). Files "Links.csv" and "Output_info.csv" is used.

For debugging - Chrome devtools.

#### Future scope:

1) Gemfile (list gem & their versions)
- Gemfile.lock (precise gem versions by Bundler)
- gemspec(specifies metainfo of project when it is a gem to another project)
2) Rakefile (comands to rake)
3) Custom commands (in irb - so/so, rakefile - maybe)
4) Common modules for debugging, retrieving multiple urls, retrieving neaded info about element at once


5) regexp
6) try to change main URL and implement some working solution

Libraries: 
- pry (alternative to irb)
- byebug (for debugging; pry-byebug adds some comands to pry)

Frameworks:
- Rails
- Sinatra
- Merb
