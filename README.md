### Junior task.

In this task i`m using CURB for opening an uri of page, NOKOGIRI - to parse this page and CSV module for writing results into a file. For retrieving information about DOM elements i use Xpath(regexp could be used for this, nontheless this is a future task). Files "Links.csv" and "Output_info.csv" is used.

For debugging - Chrome devtools.

#### Future scope:

1) Gemfile (done)
	Gemfile.lock
2) Rakefile
3) Custom commands
4) Common modules for debugging, retrieving multiple urls, retrieving neaded info about element at once

5) regexp
6) try to change main URL and implement some working solution

Libraries: 
- pry
- byebug
